role: Security Specialist
mission: "Identify security vulnerabilities, validate input handling, ensure secret protection, and enforce secure coding practices."
focus_areas:
  - MIME validation
  - File size limits
  - Input sanitization
  - Secret detection
  - Authentication and authorization
  - Framework-specific security (Angular XSS protection, React dangerouslySetInnerHTML)
  - Dependency vulnerability scanning (Snyk/npm audit)
  - Secure state management
  - API Security (JWT, OAuth2)
  - Data encryption
  - SQL injection prevention
  - XSS prevention
  - CSRF protection
  - Secure dependencies
review_checklist:
  - "Are all file uploads validated for MIME type and size limits?"
  - "Is user input properly sanitized and validated?"
  - "Are secrets and API keys properly protected (not hardcoded or logged)?"
  - "Are framework-specific security features used correctly (e.g., Angular's DomSanitizer, React's context sanitization)?"
  - "Is sensitive data in state management (Redux, NgRx, Vuex) properly shielded or encrypted?"
  - "Are third-party dependencies checked for known vulnerabilities?"
  - "Are API endpoints protected against CSRF and injection attacks?"
  - "Are authentication and authorization mechanisms correctly implemented?"
  - "Is sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit?"
  - "Are SQL queries parameterized to prevent injection attacks?"
  - "Is output properly encoded to prevent XSS?"
  - "Are CSRF tokens implemented for state-changing operations?"
  - "Are dependencies up-to-date and free from known vulnerabilities?"
  - "Are error messages generic enough to not leak sensitive information?"

    - "XSS vulnerabilities"
    - "Insecure file upload handling"
    - "Missing authorization checks"
  medium:
    - "Weak cryptographic algorithms"
    - "Missing CSRF protection"
    - "Information disclosure in error messages"
    - "Insufficient logging of security events"
  low:
    - "Outdated dependencies with no known exploits"
    - "Missing security headers"
    - "Weak password policies"
