mission: "Ensure excellent user experience, enforce accessibility standards, validate performance budgets, maintain design system compliance, and provide clear progress feedback."
focus_areas:
  - UX pattern consistency and design system compliance
  - Progress feedback and loading states
  - Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)
  - Responsive design (mobile-first, container queries)
  - Core Web Vitals (LCP < 2.5s, INP < 200ms, CLS < 0.1)
  - Error messaging (specific, actionable, user-friendly)
  - Form validation (immediate feedback, accessible error states)
  - Navigation consistency and route management
  - Internationalization (i18n) and RTL layout support
  - Framework-specific performance (Angular OnPush, trackBy, lazy loading)
  - Design system tokens (spacing, typography, color palette compliance)
  - Visual regression detection
review_checklist:
  - "Are UX patterns consistent with the rest of the application and design system?"
  - "Is progress feedback provided for long-running operations (>300ms)?"
  - "Are accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) met for all UI components?"
  - "Is the interface responsive and usable on different screen sizes (mobile-first)?"
  - "Are loading states clearly indicated to users?"
  - "Are error messages helpful, specific, and actionable?"
  - "Is form validation clear, immediate, and accessible?"
  - "Are keyboard navigation and screen readers properly supported?"
  - "Is navigation intuitive and consistent?"
  - "Are strings externalized for internationalization?"
  - "Is framework-specific performance optimized (OnPush, trackBy, lazy loading)?"
  - "Do changes stay within Core Web Vitals performance budgets?"
  - "Are design system tokens used correctly (no hardcoded colors, spacing, etc.)?"
  - "Is visual regression risk assessed (screenshot comparison for layout changes)?"
severity_levels:
  critical:
    - "No progress feedback for long operations causing user confusion"
    - "Critical accessibility violations blocking screen reader users"
    - "Forms with no validation or error messages"
    - "Core Web Vitals budget exceeded (LCP > 4s, CLS > 0.25)"
  high:
    - "Missing loading states during data fetching"
    - "Inconsistent UX patterns confusing users"
    - "Important accessibility violations (missing alt text, no keyboard navigation)"
    - "Non-responsive layout breaking on mobile devices"
    - "Design system token violations (hardcoded colors, inconsistent spacing)"
  medium:
    - "Generic error messages not helping users recover"
    - "Minor accessibility issues (color contrast, focus indicators)"
    - "Inconsistent navigation patterns"
    - "Missing internationalization support"
    - "Components not using OnPush change detection"
  low:
    - "Opportunities for UX improvement"
    - "Minor visual inconsistencies"
    - "Performance optimizations for faster rendering"
    - "Missing component Storybook documentation"
