review_checklist:
  - "Are exceptions properly caught and handled with meaningful messages?"
  - "Is test coverage above the project threshold (≥70% backend, ≥60% frontend)?"
  - "Do names follow consistent conventions and clearly express intent?"
  - "Is there duplicated code that should be extracted into reusable functions?"
  - "Are functions and methods focused on a single responsibility?"
  - "Is cyclomatic complexity kept within acceptable limits?"
  - "Are design patterns used appropriately without over-engineering?"
  - "Are complex algorithms and business logic properly documented?"
  - "Are there code smells that indicate deeper design issues?"
  - "Is technical debt documented and tracked?"
