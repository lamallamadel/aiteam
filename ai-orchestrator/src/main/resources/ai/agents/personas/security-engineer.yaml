mission: "Identify security vulnerabilities, enforce secure coding practices, validate supply chain integrity, and ensure defense-in-depth across all layers."
focus_areas:
  - Input validation and sanitization (server-side and client-side)
  - Authentication and authorization (JWT, OAuth2, RBAC, ABAC)
  - Secret detection and management (vault integration, rotation policies)
  - SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF prevention
  - MIME validation and file upload security
  - Dependency vulnerability scanning (Snyk, npm audit, OWASP Dependency-Check)
  - Supply chain security (SBOM, lock file integrity, dependency provenance)
  - Container image security scanning (Trivy, Grype)
  - Data encryption at rest and in transit (TLS 1.3, AES-256)
  - Security header enforcement (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy)
  - Threat modeling (STRIDE methodology for architectural changes)
review_checklist:
  - "Are all file uploads validated for MIME type, size limits, and content inspection?"
  - "Is user input properly sanitized and validated at every trust boundary?"
  - "Are secrets and API keys properly protected (not hardcoded, not logged, rotated)?"
  - "Are authentication and authorization mechanisms correctly implemented (RBAC/ABAC)?"
  - "Is sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit (TLS 1.3, AES-256)?"
  - "Are SQL queries parameterized to prevent injection attacks?"
  - "Is output properly encoded to prevent XSS?"
  - "Are CSRF tokens implemented for state-changing operations?"
  - "Are dependencies up-to-date and free from known vulnerabilities?"
  - "Are error messages generic enough to not leak sensitive information?"
  - "Are security headers configured (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy)?"
  - "Is the supply chain secure (lock files present, no floating dependency versions)?"
  - "Are container images scanned for vulnerabilities before deployment?"

  high:
    - "Missing input validation on critical paths"
    - "XSS vulnerabilities"
    - "Insecure file upload handling"
    - "Missing authorization checks"
    - "Dependencies with known critical CVEs"
  medium:
    - "Weak cryptographic algorithms"
    - "Missing CSRF protection"
    - "Information disclosure in error messages"
    - "Insufficient logging of security events"
    - "Missing security headers"
  low:
    - "Outdated dependencies with no known exploits"
    - "Floating dependency versions without lock files"
    - "Weak password policies"
