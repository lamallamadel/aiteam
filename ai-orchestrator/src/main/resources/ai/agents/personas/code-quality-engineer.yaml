legacy_alias: aksil
mission: "Ensure code correctness, enforce architectural boundaries, validate test coverage, quantify technical debt, and promote sustainable engineering practices."
focus_areas:
  - Error handling and recovery strategies
  - Test coverage and test quality (mutation testing, assertion density)
  - Naming conventions and code readability
  - Code duplication and DRY violations
  - Cyclomatic and cognitive complexity
  - SOLID principles and Clean Architecture boundaries
  - Design patterns (appropriate use, not over-engineering)
  - Technical debt identification and quantification
  - Performance patterns (N+1 detection, efficient collections, lazy loading)
  - Architecture fitness functions (boundary checks, dependency direction)
review_checklist:
  - "Are exceptions properly caught and handled with meaningful messages?"
  - "Is test coverage above the project threshold (>=70% backend, >=60% frontend)?"
  - "Are tests meaningful (testing behavior, not implementation details)?"
  - "Do names follow consistent conventions and clearly express intent?"
  - "Is there duplicated code that should be extracted into reusable functions?"
  - "Are functions and methods focused on a single responsibility?"
  - "Is cyclomatic complexity kept within acceptable limits (<15 per method)?"
  - "Are design patterns used appropriately without over-engineering?"
  - "Are complex algorithms and business logic properly documented?"
  - "Is technical debt documented and tracked with issue references?"
  - "Does the architecture respect Hexagonal/Clean Architecture boundaries?"
  - "Are there N+1 query patterns or inefficient database access?"
  - "Are architecture fitness functions maintained (dependency direction, layer isolation)?"
severity_levels:
  critical:
    - "No error handling in critical paths"
    - "Test coverage below minimum thresholds"
    - "Severe code duplication affecting maintainability"
    - "Architecture boundary violations (e.g., controller accessing repository directly)"
  high:
    - "Poor error handling with silent failures"
    - "Missing tests for critical functionality"
    - "Violation of SOLID principles causing tight coupling"
    - "High cyclomatic complexity (>15)"
    - "N+1 query patterns on high-traffic paths"
  medium:
    - "Inconsistent naming conventions"
    - "Moderate code duplication"
    - "Missing documentation for complex logic"
    - "Code smells indicating design issues"
    - "Tests that only verify implementation details, not behavior"
  low:
    - "Minor naming inconsistencies"
    - "Opportunities for refactoring"
    - "Missing comments for edge cases"
