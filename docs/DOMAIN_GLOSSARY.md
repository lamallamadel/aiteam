# Domain Glossary — Atlasia AI Orchestrator

Standardized terminology for the Atlasia platform. All agents, documentation, and UI surfaces must use these definitions consistently.

## Core Concepts

- **Bolt**: A complete execution of the orchestrator pipeline for one GitHub issue. A bolt progresses through all agent steps (PM through Writer) and produces a Pull Request. Internal code uses `Run`/`RunEntity`; "bolt" is the user-facing term.

- **Agent**: A specialized LLM-powered step in the pipeline. Each agent has a defined role, inputs, outputs, and operational boundaries. Agents: PM, Qualifier, Architect, Developer, Tester, Writer.

- **Gem (Persona)**: A domain-expert AI personality used for interactive chat and code review. Four gems: Aabo (Security), Aksil (Code Quality), Imad (Infrastructure), Tiziri (Frontend/UX).

- **Artifact**: A structured output produced by an agent step. Stored as JSONB in the `ai_run_artifact` table. Examples: `ticket_plan.json`, `work_plan.json`, `architecture_notes.md`, `test_report.json`, `pr_url`.

## Workflow Terminology

- **Sequential Orchestration**: The pipeline pattern where specialized agents execute in linear order, each processing the structured output of the preceding step.

- **Quality Gate**: An automated verification checkpoint that must pass before the pipeline advances. Defined in `docs/QUALITY_GATES.md`. Includes CI verification, coverage thresholds, and security checks.

- **Escalation**: A human intervention request triggered when an agent encounters an unresolvable blocker. Produces an `escalation.json` artifact conforming to `ai/schemas/escalation.schema.json`. The workflow pauses until the human decides to PROCEED or ABORT.

- **Fix Loop**: An automated retry cycle for CI or E2E test failures. The tester agent diagnoses the failure, patches the code, and re-runs tests. Limits: max 3 CI iterations, max 2 E2E iterations. Exceeding limits triggers escalation.

- **Ticket Plan**: The PM agent's output — a structured breakdown of a GitHub issue into stories, acceptance criteria, risks, and suggested labels. Schema: `ai/schemas/ticket_plan.schema.json`.

- **Work Plan**: The Qualifier agent's output — refined requirements with edge cases, test data, branch name, and verification commands. Schema: `ai/schemas/work_plan.schema.json`.

## Architecture Terminology

- **Dual-Mode Architecture**: Atlasia operates in two modes: Code Mode (autonomous pipeline triggered by `ai:run` label) and Chat Mode (interactive dialogue with Gem personas).

- **Human-on-the-Loop (HOTL)**: The oversight paradigm where agents operate autonomously by default, with human engineers intervening only at escalation thresholds or boundary conditions. Contrasted with Human-in-the-Loop (HITL), where every step requires approval.

- **Chain of Thought (CoT)**: The explicit reasoning trace generated by the LLM during architectural and implementation decisions. Must be visible in the trace observability dashboard for debugging and audit.

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: A secure, permission-aware framework for connecting LLMs with external data sources, tools, and development environments.

## Observability Terminology

- **Correlation ID**: A UUID propagated through MDC (Mapped Diagnostic Context) for distributed tracing across the workflow. Generated at workflow start, included in all log entries, and returned in `X-Correlation-ID` response headers.

- **Neural Trace**: The frontend visualization of the orchestration pipeline's execution flow. Displays agent nodes, connections, and active status as an interactive graph.

- **Waterfall Trace**: A hierarchical view of workflow execution showing nested spans (agent steps, LLM calls, schema validations) with duration bars, similar to browser DevTools Network tab.

## Invariants

- A bolt cannot modify files outside the repository allowlist (`backend/`, `frontend/`, `docs/`, `infra/`, `ai/`).
- A bolt cannot modify `.github/workflows/` without human escalation.
- A bolt cannot commit directly to `main` — a Pull Request is always required.
- CI fix loops are capped at 3 iterations; E2E fix loops at 2.
- Every agent artifact must validate against its JSON schema (when one exists).
